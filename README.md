# WaterCooler
![WaterCooler in action!](screenshots/watercooler_maxhatesadminsteve.png)
## Description
WaterCooler is a free and open-source group chat application designed for use internally within offices and organizations. The intention is to provide a FOSS counterweight to proprietary, SaaS solutions such as Campfire and HipChat, and provide a solution for people looking to host a rich, multi-room chat application behind their firewall on their own hardware.

### Features
* Multple Chat rooms with the option to restrict to certains users and groups.
* Rich, realtime chat functionality
    * Remote image inclusion
    * YouTube & Vimeo link parse-to-details functionality
    * GitHub and Bitbucket PUSH service hook integration
* Useable on different screen sizes (responsive)
* Easily deployable to Heroku

## Limitations
There are currently a number of limitations, outside of unimplemented application functionality. There are currently a number of features missing from the Waterline ORM, namely support for associations and aggregate functions. As a result, there are a number of inefficent workarounds in-place to emulate this behavior. These usually involve fetching a whole collection and iterating over each entry to filter out entries that don't match the conditions. I'm looking into whether or not it would be worth the effort to switch to Mongoose ODM at the cost of database portability, or whether I should just wait until Waterline catches up.

## Requirements
* Node.js (only tested on 0.10.x)
* MongoDB
* Redis

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `$ npm install`
3. Modify config/adapters.js and config/session.js with your MongoDB and Redis info
    * If deploying to Herkou, the application will just use your instance's MongoLab and RedisCloud details.
4. Start the server with `$ node app.js`. It's should now be running on [http://127.0.0.1:1337](http://127.0.0.1:1337) by default.
5. (optional) For YouTube URL parsing, put your YouTube API key in assets/config.json
6. Login with user: `admin` password: `changeme` **and change the password**

## Technologies In Use
* Node.js + Express + Sails.js + Socket.io
* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* jQuery
* MongoDB
* Redis
